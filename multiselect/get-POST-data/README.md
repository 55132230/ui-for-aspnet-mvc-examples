# CRUD operations with MultiColumnComboBox

The MultiColumnComboBox is a view-only widget by design and does not provide edit, delete and create features.

You can implement them, however, by adding custom buttons to its [templates](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/editors/multicolumncombobox/overview#templates) and handling events from them to, for example, show AJAX forms from partial views in a popup.

## Prerequisites

This example steps on the [Using Kendo Window for MVC with AJAX Forms](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-examples/tree/master/window/KendoWindow-Ajax-Form) example so you should get familiar with its concepts and requirements.
